He was previously chairman of The Trump Organization and the host of The Apprentice. Long expressing an interest in national politics, he announced his run for President of the United States in 2015. Despite a campaign that courted numerous controversies, he was selected as the Republican presidential candidate in July 2016. After an exceptionally bitter and divisive election campaign, he then went on to beat <a href=#>Hillary Clinton</a> in a huge upset.</p><p>In doing so he became one of five presidents to lose the popular vote but to win a majority of the electoral college. He is also the oldest person to be elected president, at 70 years. In his first term Trump issued executive orders to ban travel from certain areas of the world, controversially dismissed FBI director <a href=#>James Comey</a> and withdrew the United States from both the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He also unsuccessfully attempted to repeal Obamacare.</p><p>Trump's presidency has been involved in numerous controversies including investigations by a special prosecutor into allegations that his campaign colluded with Russian officials.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>June 14</a>, <a href=#>1946</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Queens, New York, USA<br><b>Age: <a href=#>78 years
